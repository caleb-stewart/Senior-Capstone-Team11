# Which aspects of the current work are the easiest to understand?
The easiest aspect of the project to understand is the overall goal. Our objective is to detect and track logos in video footage to analyze branding visibility, which provides a clear direction for our work.

# Which aspects of the current work are the hardest to understand?
The most challenging aspect to understand is how to effectively integrate the object detection model. The main difficulty lies in selecting the best approach for tracking logos over time and ensuring accurate logo detection across different frames within a video.

# Which aspects of the current work are the easiest to approach?
The research phase has been relatively straightforward. We have explored existing object and logo detection models and found several articles detailing how others have fine-tuned models for logo tracking, providing a solid foundation for our approach.

# Which aspects of the current work are the hardest to approach?
The most challenging aspect to approach is selecting an appropriate dataset and determining the best way to train the model for accurate logo detection. Ensuring the dataset is diverse enough to handle variations in size, lighting, and occlusion adds to the complexity.

# Which aspects of the current work are the easiest to solve?
The easiest aspect to solve has been deciding on our frontend and backend frameworks. As a team, we agreed to use React.js for the front end and Python for the back end, providing a clear foundation for development.

# Which aspects of the current work are the hardest to solve?
The most difficult aspect to solve is selecting the right image detection approach. While we are leaning toward YOLOv8, we still need to determine whether to use a pre-trained model or train our own, as well as identify the most suitable dataset for accurate logo detection. There are still many unknowns in this area.

# Which aspects of the current work are the easiest to evaluate?
The easiest aspect to evaluate at this stage is whether the chosen model can successfully detect a logo in a static image. This is a straightforward yes-or-no test, and we can reference similar projects that have achieved this with comparable models to validate our approach.

# Which aspects of the current work are the hardest to evaluate?
The most challenging aspect to evaluate is determining whether our chosen dataset is sufficient for accurate logo detection or if using a pre-trained model would yield better results. Assessing the datasetâ€™s quality and its impact on model performance will require thorough testing and experimentation.

# How far along (as a percent) do you feel you are toward the final goal? Does this pace seem likely to succeed?
1%. This was sprint 1, and I think we are starting to get a good base going. If we continue at this pace focusing on milestones, success seems likely.
